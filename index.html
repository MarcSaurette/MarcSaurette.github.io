				<p>My research interests revolve around the lives and literary production of the monks of Cluny. The abbey of Cluny, located near Macon in Burgundy, was founded in the early tenth century as –what could be argued to be– a traditionally Carolingian form of monastery. Its life revolved around the cultivation of virtue and spiritual prestige through an unparalleled program of prayers, liturgical celebration and ritualized comportment.

          I have focused my research on three authors writing within the Cluniac mileu: the twelfth-century abbot of Cluny –Peter the Venerable– and two of his monks –Peter of Poitiers and Richard of Poitiers (also known as Richard of Cluny). Through the writing of these three monks, I seek to explore the world view, the power relationships and the forms of emotion disseminated from Cluny.
